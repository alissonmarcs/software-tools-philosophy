### steps ###

# tr
# 1 - $1 will be input of tr, that convert all characters to lowercase.
# 2 - remove all characteres that are not alphanum, '_', ' ' and '\n'.
#   -c operate on complement of '[:alnum:]_ \n', i.e, all character that are
#	not in this string set. -d delete all those characters.
# 3 - put one word per line, this makes the counting operation much easier.
# 4 - first sort to put all equal lines adjacent, since uniq only count
#	adjacent lines.
# 5 - merge equal adjacent lines, and prefix the number of occurrences.
# 6 - final numered (all lines are prefixed by a number) and reversed
#	(from biggest to smallest) sort.
